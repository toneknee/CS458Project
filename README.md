# CS458Project
VR board game project

Hello,

This project was created for my CS 458 class to help me learn how to code a 3D project in Unity. All assets were either pulled from the Unity asset store for free or created by me. The zip file was too large for github so I added the drive link to the project file in the DEMO.txt
